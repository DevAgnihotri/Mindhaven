## Instructions

- Hover the purple buttons to see their function
- Click the purple buttons to satisfy your MarioBuddy's demands
- Don't worry if some things start acting strange or malfunctioning; everything will be fine after 13 days

## Considerations

- MindHaven: MarioBuddy takes about 10 minutes to play. There is no save function, so you have to play it all at once
- The game requires a lot of reading in English
